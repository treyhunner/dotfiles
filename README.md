# Trey Hunner's dotfiles

These are my configuration files.  I use these files when configuring my
account on a new system.

## Installation

This repository (or a fork of this repo) is meant to be stored in a permanent
location in your home directory so symbolic links of each applicable dotfile
can be linked to it.

Move this dotfiles directory to a semi-permanent home (e.g. `~/.dotfiles`) and
execute the included `install` script:

```bash
$ git clone git://github.com/treyhunner/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
$ cd ~/.dotfiles/
$ ./scripts/install
$ ./scripts/additional_install
# Setup Dropbox
$ ./scripts/symlink  # Dependent upon Dropbox directory
$ ./scripts/restore /media/trey/somedrive/backup
```
